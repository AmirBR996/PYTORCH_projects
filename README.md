## Projects

### 1. Fashion MNIST - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- A neural network model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset for image classification.
- Uses PyTorch to build, train, and evaluate the model.
- Folder: `/fashion-mnist-ann`
- Key features: Data preprocessing, model architecture, training loop, evaluation metrics.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- A sentiment analysis model to classify text as positive or negative.
- Built using PyTorch and natural language processing techniques.
- Folder: `/sentiment-analysis`
- Key features: Text preprocessing, word embeddings, model training, accuracy evaluation.
